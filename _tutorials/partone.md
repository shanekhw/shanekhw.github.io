## Test Subheader 2
This is math:

$$\begin{matrix}
x & y & z \\ 
\hline 
0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline \end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
ab + \bar{a}c + bc &=  ab + \bar{a}c + (\bar{a}+a)bc\\
&=ab + abc+ \bar{a}c + \bar{a}bc \\
&= ab(1+c) + \bar{a}c (1+b)\\
&=ab + \bar{a}c\end{aligned}$$

### Test Subsubheader 3

<div class="yellowbox"> Note that minimised boolean forms are not necessarily unique. The number of terms left in the final expression is unique but its possible to have a different form. </div>
